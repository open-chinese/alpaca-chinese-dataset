It was covered in a thick layer of dust, carefully bound in worn, brown leather. She pulled the book off the shelf and saw that it had no title or author, a fact that immediately piqued her curiosity. \n\nCurious, she carefully opened the pages of the book and discovered a hand-crafted journal filled with detailed descriptions of places, people and events that were different from anything she had ever read before. She could tell, from careful observation, that the journal had been written by a man who lived several centuries before and that his observations had been extremely accurate. \n\nAnne was ultimately able to track down the journal's origin and discovered that the man who wrote it had been missing for centuries. She became renowned among historians for her work, and the journal itself eventually went on to become an important research resource for many in the field. \n\nAnne discovered that sometimes, old books can hide a great deal more than dusty stories.",

Variables help to store, manipulate and use data. Expressions are composed of variables, literals and operators. Loops allow a particular section of code to be repeated multiple times. Control structures provide the ability to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions. Functions are reusable blocks of code. Classes are used to create types in the language. Libraries are collections of pre-existing code which can be leveraged to develop a program. Frameworks provide structure and API’s to simplify the development of programs.",

It looked very different from modern cities, with cobblestone roads and small stone houses, but so fascinatingly beautiful.\n\nShe continued to explore the city, and soon discovered it was filled with a variety of fascinating sights, from an old fountain in the center of town to a library filled with books. In one corner of town, Francesca found an old statue of a woman looking out into the horizon with a wistful expression. \n\nFrancesca stayed in the city until it was dark, when she reluctantly returned home. She was amazed to find a hidden city so close to her home, and wondered how long it had been forgotten and what stories it held.\n\nEvery day, Francesca would go back to explore more of the forgotten city and its mysteries, and she found solace in the ancient beauty of this hidden place.",

In the 1990s, advancements in computer vision led to the development of more powerful and sophisticated methods such as convolutional neural networks, feature-based image registration, and content-based image retrieval.
